- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @shawn-nt

I'm not a software developer, just a maker/hacker using his duct tape and keyboard to the best of his ability to experiment and make what I need.

I have been experimenting with how blockchain can connect and engage users in real world activities, and enjoying the process of learning.  As I continue the journey I hope to further expand the experiment to demonstrate novel uses and ways that "real-world" small businesses can reap significant benefits from the use of this technology.  I love being a bridge between non-tech users and the technology that can improve their lives or businesses.
