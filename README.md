- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @shawn-nt

I'm not a legitimate software developer, just a maker/hacker using his duct tape and keyboard to the best of his ability to experiment and make what I need.

Seeking collaborators for a project that could bring the benefits of the blockchain to more 'real world', local businesses.  This will be an adventure and a community, join us on the trail. shawn at narrativetrails.xyz if you want to geek out about exploring blockchain, the outdoors and/or helping independent small businesses use technology.

Email me at shawn at narrativetrails.xyz to connect.
